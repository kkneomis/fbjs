NOTES SECTION http://screencast.com/t/QxvUpepuV

Question: Please explain how you are using publish_actions to enhance a person's in-app experience.

This app is used in conjunction with a jQuery plugin (jQueryFacebookWall) to display and interact with a Facebook pages 
feed, photo and album data. The publish_actions permission is used to allow users to post likes and comments 
to the graph api for feed stories, photos, and albums.

IMPORTANT! PLEASE NOTE, the app must have publish_actions permission to function. The app do not use Facebook share plugins like the "Like Button", "Share Dialog" or
like those listed here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins
Instead the app makes Facebook graph api posts via the facebook javascript sdk to add likes and comments to posts and photos. 
These api posts require the publish_actions permissions.


Question: What type of content (e.g. photos, stories) does your app share, and what button do people click to 
publish to Facebook? Please add detailed instructions so our review team can reproduce this permission.

The app retrieves stories, photos, and events. It posts likes and comments to stories and photos though
a user interface similar to facebooks. There 'Like' links for the user to like stories or photos, and
comment inputs to add comments. The like links and comments are clearly associated with particular 
stories and photos. See these examples 
http://ironlasso.com/jqueryfacebookwall-plugin/

Instructions to recreate a publish_actions request
1) Go to *whatEverYourDomainIs.com*/pathToJqueryFacebookWall/e
2) When the facebook feed loads click a like link on one of the posts.


FACEBOOK LOGIN INTEGRATION
Question: Please provide step-by-step instructions in English that show how to access Facebook Login.

1) Go to http://ironlasso.com/jQueryFacebookWall/index.html 

2) click a like link on a post or add a comment to a post. see here http://screencast.com/t/qls362ch0dYu

If you  are not logged to Facebook and or have not accepted the facebook app, the jQuery plugin will prompt you to login to facebook. The jQuery plugin does this via Facebook's javascript SDK https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/login-flow-for-web/v2.4

It requests permissions to act on the users behalf via pop up window. This popup is generated by the facebook javascript sdk which the jQuery plugin loaded when it was instantiated.  ( IF DONT SEE THE PLUGIN, MAKE SURE THE POPUP IS NOT BLOCKED BY YOUR BROWSER)

APP PREVIEW IMAGES	
Example preview images are provided with the plugin: see jQueryFacebookWall/images/facebookAppPermissions/. You may use these images when applying for publish_actions
approval. However many users have reported that the screen shots must be specific to the domain the plugin is installed on to get approval.
Therefore you are strongly encouraged to make your own screen shots for app permissions request submissions.
